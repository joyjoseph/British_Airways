The steps taken are;

### 1. Scraping data from Skytrax

For this task, we will reviews the [British Airways Airline data](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).  `Python` and `BeautifulSoup` will be used to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.

### 2. Analyse the data

Once we have the dataset, we will prepare it. The data is very messy and contain purely text. We will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, we should perform several analysis to uncover some insights. 

### 3. Present insights

We will summarise our findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that the results can be presented at the next board meeting. We would create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from our analysis.
