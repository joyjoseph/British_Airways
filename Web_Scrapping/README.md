# Web scraping to gain company insights

For this task, we would Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways. For this, we should use a website called [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com). The team leader wants us to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. We would collect as much data as we can in order to improve the output of the analysis.

### Analyse data
Once we have the dataset, we will prepare it. The data is very messy and contain purely text. We will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, we should perform several analysis to uncover some insights. 

### Present insights
We have been required by the manager to summarise our findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. We would create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from our analysis.
