    "British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this task, we will reviews the [British Airways Airline data](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).  `Python` and `BeautifulSoup` will be used to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Analyse the data\n",
    "Once we have the dataset, we will prepare it. The data is very messy and contain purely text. We will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, we should perform several analysis to uncover some insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Present insights\n",
    "We have been required by the manager to summarise our findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. We would create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from our analysis.\n"
